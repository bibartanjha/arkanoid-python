## Overview
For this game, I followed this tutorial https://new.pythonforengineers.com/blog/your-first-game-in-python-in-less-than-30-minutes/. 

I initially wanted to follow this tutorial in order to learn the logic behind arkanoid (i.e. how to properly change the ball's angles as it hits the brickets, the walls, or the paddle at the bottom)
This is because I would like to add an Arkanoid game to my Android app https://github.com/bibartanjha/android-games-app/

Through this tutorial, I was able to learn the logic behind Arkanoid and also familiarize myself with the Pygame Zero API (which I had known about prior to this tutorial). 

## Instructions on running game
Run `python game.py` to start the game

Press q or w for pause and play, respectively. Also, press w to start the game and start each new round.

Use right and left arrow buttons to move paddle
